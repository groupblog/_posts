### Introduction
> <font size=2>The 8-puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Eight, Mystic Square and many others) is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order (see diagram) by making sliding moves that use the empty space. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle)</font>

This is a classical problem for modelling algorithms involving heuristics. Commonly used heuristics include counting the number of misplaced tiles and finding the sum of the taxicab distances between each block and its position in the goal configuration. Note that both are admissible, i.e. they never overestimate the number of moves left, which ensures optimality for certain search algorithms such as A*.

### Best-first search
Best-first search is a search algorithm which explores a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule.
The most famous BFS is A* search algorithm.
> <font size=2>A* meaning that it solves problems by searching among all possible paths to the solution (goal) for the one that incurs the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.), and among these paths it first considers the ones that appear to lead most quickly to the solution. It is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific node of a graph, it constructs a tree of paths starting from that node, expanding paths one step at a time, until one of its paths ends at the predetermined goal node. - [wikipedia][1]</font>

### Game tree
> <font size=2>In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game and whose edges are moves. The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the extensive-form game representation. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_tree)</font>


### Priority Queue
Priority Queue is a special queue which have a "Priority" attribute in each of the elements. The element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue. Usually a priority queue is implemented with a heap.

### Project
For this project, we use N by N blocks to represent a 8 puzzle board, every time moving "0 value" block to get a neighbor, then create a node inserting the board, a priority value and the number of moves to get this board from origin. At last use A* search algorithm to find the path to get goal.

The goal of this project is to implement 2 class:
```java
public class Board {
    public Board(int[][] blocks)           // construct a board from an N-by-N array of blocks
                                           // (where blocks[i][j] = block in row i, column j)
    public int dimension()                 // board dimension N
    public int hamming()                   // number of blocks out of place
    public int manhattan()                 // sum of Manhattan distances between blocks and goal
    public boolean isGoal()                // is this board the goal board?
    public Board twin()                    // a board that is obtained by exchanging any pair of blocks
    public boolean equals(Object y)        // does this board equal y?
    public Iterable<Board> neighbors()     // all neighboring boards
    public String toString()               // string representation of this board (in the output format specified below)

    public static void main(String[] args) // unit tests (not graded)
}

public class Solver {
    public Solver(Board initial)           // find a solution to the initial board (using the A* algorithm)
    public boolean isSolvable()            // is the initial board solvable?
    public int moves()                     // min number of moves to solve initial board; -1 if unsolvable
    public Iterable<Board> solution()      // sequence of boards in a shortest solution; null if unsolvable
    public static void main(String[] args) // solve a slider puzzle (given below)
}
```

The first class is to create the board with two heuristics: hamming and manhattan. This class should implement equals method in order to compare two boards.
The second class is to create node as a private class, and use node to simulate A* search algorithm to find a goal.


> **Note:**
>  1. The board class should create a twin board by changing position of "0 value" block with one other so that one of the two board must could get to goal.
>  2. node should have a pointer points to the previous node, when we find a goal, we could get the path by keeping calling previous.
