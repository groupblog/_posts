### Introduction
<p><strong>AngularJS</strong> is an open-sourced web application JavaScript framework designed for Single Page Applications (SPA). An SPA is a web application or website that fits into a single web page. It is a design choice intended to provide a more fluid user experience. Angular’s data binding and dependency injection make your application’s components clear and succinct. If you are building a game or a computationally intensive math application, Angular may not fit your particular requirements, however, for generic web applications it should serve as a viable framework to build upon.</p>

<p><strong>Bootstrap</strong> is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins. Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs</p>
